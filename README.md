# Typesense Dashboard (typesense-dashboard)

A Typesense Dashboard to manage and browse collections.

A side projet to test the Typesense API and Quasar with electron.

## Usage

### Web
As a web application, only typesense server started with `--enable-cors` will work.

Use https://bfritscher.github.io/typesense-dashboard/ or build and install on your own server

#### Docker

self-host this dashboard with docker* (web version has some limitations import/export size of files)

use environement variable `PUBLIC_PATH` if you need something else than `/`

Example usage:
```bash
$ docker build -t typesense-dashboard .
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 typesense-dashboard
```

`caddy` is used for serving the actual files.
One could also copy `/srv` from the final Docker Image into another:
```Dockerfile
FROM alpine
COPY --from=typesense-dashboard /srv /typesense-dashboard
```

To build and serve from a subfolder `/example` (must start with /)

```bash
docker build --build-arg=PUBLIC_PATH=/example -t typesense-dashboard .
```

You can also use the pre-built docker image for example like this:
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 ghcr.io/bfritscher/typesense-dashboard:latest
```

### Desktop

With the desktop application everything except instant search will work without cors.
To export or import large json or ljson files, desktop version is required, because the browser version times out.

Download from the [release page](https://github.com/bfritscher/typesense-dashboard/releases) or build your own.

#### *Linux*
App cannot be started by clicking on it, on Nautilus[*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55060402/electron-executable-not-recognized-by-nautilus)

Make it executable and then you can run it from command line.
